<p>This is where I have gradually added GWT classes and methods as needed to support 
certain GWT-based projects.  I have tried to keep the Java version of Cesium APIs 
closely matched to the JavaScript APIs, so many Cesium JavaScript examples will easily 
port to a Java (GWT) translation.  Not all of the Cesium APIs are implemented though, but 
if you need additional classes or methods, they are pretty easy to create.  Just follow 
the same pattern.  Note how the "Option" classes work, to mimic how some Cesium 
JavaScript classes take an Object of optional named parameters; and look at how JsCallbacks work. 
Also <a href="https://github.com/richkadel/cesium-gwt/tree/master/src/main/java/com/harmonia/cesiumsamples">look at 
the samples</a> to get an idea of how to use cesium-gwt. 
Here's a <a href="cesium-gwt/cesium-gwt.html">simple demo page</a> you can 
create in your own environment with "mvn clean package war:war"</p>

<h3>
<a name="to-do" class="anchor" href="#to-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To do</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>(Near term): Upgrade from the current matching Cesium JS version (b28) 
to the latest version (b30, as of July 7, but it may be better just to wait for
the imminent 1.0 release). This usually takes about an hour for a first pass, 
but I just haven't done it yet. Since there is not a lot of automation or 
error checking in JavaScript at development time, it has to be done by hand 
and it's easy to make a mistake or miss a changed Cesium class.</p></li>
<li><p>Add more classes and methods. I implemented only the classes I really needed to have for my development.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider writing a translator to translate Cesium JS APIs to cesium-gwt. The translation design pattern is fairly straightforward. Perhaps a modification of the software that generates the Cesium reference documentation could be adapted.</p></li>
<li><p>Write JavaDoc! Again, here's where a translator from Cesium's docs to cesium-gwt would come in handy.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement test cases.</p></li>

</ol><p>I don't have a lot of time to work on this, and unless required for my projects, I may not be able to do much except the occasional few hours of personal time. But I would be ecstatic if others wanted to contribute to the above goals.</p>
