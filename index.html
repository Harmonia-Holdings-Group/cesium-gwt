<h2>New Tagged Release - Cesium-GWT 0.1.1</h2>

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/markerikson">Mark Erikson</a> for significant contributions
and improvements made in this new release. Mark and I filled out several additional classes
and methods, and made some improvements to the basic implementation style. This new release
changes a few APIs from our previous 0.1 release, but Java compile-time checking should
help you find any required changes very quickly. Some of the new capabilities include
the ability to draw new shapes (box, polygon, polygon outlines, circles) and extrude them (make
3D solid or translucent shapes), improved camera controls, callback handling for "picking"
primitives (e.g., to click on an extruded circle--a cylinder drawn vertically from the Earth's
surface--and get a callback to tell you what you clicked), more input events (we now support but have
not fully tested touch events), more Imagery and Terrain providers, methods to adjust imagery
colors (e.g., saturation, brightness), Materials handling,
some CZML support, and some SkyBox support!

<h2>Compatible with Cesium 1.0</h2>

<p>This is where I have gradually added GWT classes and methods as needed to support 
certain GWT-based projects.  I have tried to keep the Java version of Cesium APIs 
closely matched to the JavaScript APIs, so many Cesium JavaScript examples will easily 
port to a Java (GWT) translation.  Not all of the Cesium APIs are implemented though, but 
if you need additional classes or methods, they are pretty easy to create.  Just follow 
the same pattern.  Note how the "Option" classes work (e.g., inner classes 
CesiumWidget.Options, Camera.FlyToOptions, and classes Label and Billboard), 
to mimic how some Cesium JavaScript classes take an Object of optional named 
parameters; and look at how JsCallbacks/EventListeners work (the CesiumWidgetPlayer
has a good example for showing the mouse position under the cursor), and also how
Enums are implemented. </p>

<p>Also <a href="https://github.com/richkadel/cesium-gwt/tree/master/cesium-gwt-test/src/main/java/com/harmonia/cesiumsamples">look at 
the samples</a> to get an idea of how to use cesium-gwt.
I recently created a subpackage called "sandcastle" to start to capture samples
that mirror the Cesium JavaScript sandcastle demos. I've started with a couple that
show off some of the newer capabilities, such as extruded polygons, improved camera
controls, and scene morphing.
Here's a <a href="cesium-gwt/cesium-gwt.html">simple demo page</a> you can 
create in your own environment with "mvn clean package war:war"</p>

<h3>
<a name="recent-improvements" class="anchor" href="#recent-improvements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Recent improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>I upgraded the library to work with all of the changes in Cesium 1.0. Now that Cesium is 1.0, 
there should not be any more "breaking changes" to the underlying library (hopefully), so 
cesium-gwt should continue to work with fugure Cesium updates.</li>
<li>The latest version(s) of Cesium fixed a number of bugs!  So I was able to remove many of
the hacks I had incorporated to work around old bugs, now fixed. This makes cesium-gwt
smaller and cleaner.</li>
<li>The latest version of Cesium moved some things around and this also improved cesium-gwt's
implementation, for example, flyTo is much simpler, and Billboard creation is drastically
improved with the ability to just provide an image URL and let Cesium handle loading the
image. (Although you may still want to load your own Image element first and provide the
loaded image to Cesium, if you need to get the image width and height from the loaded
image. I had to do this in one of my applications.)</li>
<li>I changed how Enumerations work to be much more consistent with Java enums, but still
map to Cesium's JavaScript enumeration implementation.</li>
<li>I implemented the required GWT classes and methods to support the position picking
(to display the mouse position), as shown in the sample "CesiumWidgetPlayer".</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="to-do" class="anchor" href="#to-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To do</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Add more classes and methods. I implemented only the classes I really needed to have for my development.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider writing a translator to translate Cesium JS APIs to cesium-gwt. The translation design pattern is fairly straightforward. Perhaps a modification of the software that generates the Cesium reference documentation could be adapted.</p></li>
<li><p>Write JavaDoc! Again, here's where a translator from Cesium's docs to cesium-gwt would come in handy.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement test cases.</p></li>

</ol><p>I don't have a lot of time to work on this, and unless required for my projects, I may not be able to do much except the occasional few hours of personal time. But I would be ecstatic if others wanted to contribute to the above goals.</p>
