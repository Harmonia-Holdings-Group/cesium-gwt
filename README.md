cesium-gwt
==========

GWT wrappers around some of the Cesium JS library.

The latest version has been upgraded to Cesium 1.0, so hopefully cesium-gwt is 
now forward-compatible with future Cesium JS releases.

The project page, including "To Do's", can be found at 
http://richkadel.github.io/cesium-gwt.
